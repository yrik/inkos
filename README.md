Adapted OS for e-ink tablets - allows to use work-related apps with no harm for eyes

### Concept
There are many e-ink devices running androids, however, they are not really usable for work-related apps.
In my daily life I use slack, telegram, zoom and draw.io. Let's make an android app that would have a markteplace for the apps adapted for e-ink experience. They should reduce amount of refreshes to the minimum. Working technology for apps are html and JS. However, apps should follow guidelines to be usable on device with no colors, minimum shades, and low refresh-rate.

### Why?
E-ink displays don't light in your eyes, they use reflected light, which is natural and causes less tireness.
